                <p id="1" style="display: none; color: white;">
                    In this case study, we explore art - the different ways through which art allows us to express
                    ourselves. Art can take on various forms and sizes, serving as a means to bring our imagination
                    to reality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Previously, art was rather exclusive; only those who were exceptionally talented or those who
                    dedicated an absurd amount of time to practice and refine their skills were able to express
                    themselves. However, the rise of technology has dramatically reshaped this landscape. It has
                    made art creation easier and more accessible to a broader audience. Tools such as Photoshop
                    and Canva, used for image creation and manipulation, as well as music software that enables
                    experimentation with various instruments, have enabled individuals from all walks of life to
                    engage in the act of art creation. The transformative introduction of AI has further
                    revolutionized the field.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, thanks to technologies like Stable Diffusion, you can bring any
                    visual or design you dream of to life with a simple prompt. This introduction of AI technology
                    serves as a catalyst, enhancing our imaginative capabilities and spanning various domains,
                    including music, illustration, fashion, architecture, and more.
                    Now, the exciting part is up to you. Your goal is to create an AI that not only produces art but
                    also addresses real art-world problems. Keep it practical, though. The art it creates should be
                    useful and make sense in the real world. Balancing creativity with real-world usefulness is the
                    key. Therefore, by combining AI with art, you're not just creating aesthetically pleasing things
                    – you're shaping the art world.

                    In this case study, we explore social good – the effort to uplift as many lives as possible
                    through meaningful actions. Social good encompasses efforts that aim to advance society and
                    enhance the well-being of individuals. In this case study, our aim is to explore how AI plays a
                    crucial role in addressing diverse challenges and propelling us towards a more promising
                    future.
                    <br><br>
                    We encounter an array of challenges that impact lives on a global scale, including healthcare
                    access, inequalities in education, and environmental issues. As technology takes center stage,
                    we observe its innovative applications gradually diminishing some of these problems. With the
                    rise of technology, our capacity to tackle numerous challenges has expanded. Digital solutions
                    have enabled remote communication, streamlined operations, and improved access to
                    information. Despite this, certain complex challenges remain difficult to address.
                    <br><br>

                    The introduction of AI has reshaped the approach to problem-solving. AI's ability to analyze
                    vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and make predictions has opened new avenues for
                    addressing longstanding issues. It brings us closer to finding solutions that were once
                    considered unsolvable. AI's potential spans a wide spectrum of issues – from predicting
                    disease outbreaks and optimizing transportation systems to combating climate change. AI
                    possesses the capacity to touch lives and reshape societies in unprecedented ways.
                    <br><br>

                    Now, it's your opportunity to contribute to the betterment of society. Your mission is to
                    develop an AI model that focuses on a real-world problem, enriching the lives of individuals or
                    society as a whole. As you embark on this journey, remember that the essence of AI lies not
                    only in its innovation but also in its potential to drive positive change. By harnessing its
                    capabilities, you hold the power to shape a brighter future. So, roll up your sleeves, embrace
                    creative thinking, and let's create AI solutions that make the world a better place for everyone.

                    In this case study, we explore entertainment – a way for us to alleviate our day-to-day stress
                    and bring joy to our lives. Whether it's through movies, music, or video games, its purpose
                    lies in enhancing our moments of leisure. With the rise of the digital age, entertainment has
                    assumed a new form, readily accessible at our fingertips anytime and anywhere. As we
                    embrace this trend, it's now AI's turn to take center stage and revolutionize how we engage
                    with entertainment.
                    <br><br>
                    AI's impact has changed every aspect of the entertainment industry. In movies, it collaborates
                    in content creation and video editing. In gaming, it creates lifelike environments, offering
                    users immersive experiences. In virtual reality, AI-driven avatars interact seamlessly with
                    users, immersing them in interactive narratives, among many other examples that leverage the
                    power of AI. It's time for creators to envision AI’s potential in addressing real-world
                    challenges within the entertainment landscape.
                    <br><br>
                    And now, it's your time to shine – envision a world where AI tackles challenges in
                    entertainment, bringing people closer through shared experiences, enabling relaxation, and
